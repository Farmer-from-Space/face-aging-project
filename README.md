## Project topic
### Missing Children Current Face Prediction

#### The reason we chose this topic

##### All the team members wanted to try the face detecting and CycleGAN series models, and while looking for a suitable model, we found Lifespan Age Transformation Synthesis (LATS) and decided to try it.
[LATS] https://github.com/royorel/Lifespan_Age_Transformation_Synthesis
##### Then, after thinking about how to use the model we found, We thought it would be good to predict the present state of the children who was lost, so we started this project.

## Why using colab
##### The first plan was to implement a web service through flask in the local environment.
##### However, the computer we are using is an M1 imac, there is a compatibility issue with pytorch and it is difficult to use the GPU, so we decided to implement it through google colab. We used ngrok to run flask in colab.
